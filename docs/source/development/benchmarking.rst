Benchmarking Code
==================

In ProbNum computational cost with regard to time and memory is measured via a benchmark suite.
Benchmarks are run by `airspeed velocity <https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ which tracks
performance changes over time.

Check out ProbNum's `benchmarks <comingsoon>`_ (coming soon!) for its probabilistic numerical methods
and related functions!


Creating Benchmarks
********************
You can add a new benchmark by following `this tutorial <https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writing_benchmarks.html>`_.
