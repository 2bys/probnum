# Creating an Example Notebook

Functionality of `probnum` is explained in detail in the form of `jupyter` notebooks under `/docs/source/notebooks`. 
These can be added to the documentation by 
1. Creating a `.ipynb` notebook in `/docs/source/notebooks/`.
2. Adding the notebook in the appropriate section in `/docs/source/notebooks/examples.rst`.

Note that notebooks must start with a upper level markdown header (`# Header`) to be converted correctly.
