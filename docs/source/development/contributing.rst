Benchmarking Code
-----------------

In ProbNum computational cost with regard to time and memory is measured via a benchmark suite.
Benchmarks are run by `airspeed velocity <https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ which tracks
performance changes over time. Check out `ProbNum's benchmarks <coming soon>`_ for its probabilistic numerical methods
and related functions!

You can add a new benchmark by following `this tutorial <https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writing_benchmarks.html>`_.
