See the notebooks below to learn more about how to use ProbNum and its functionality. We give an overview of the main
submodules and their probabilistic numerical methods as well as some case studies demonstrating applications. For
advanced users there is a tutorial on extending existing code. If you want to try out the examples for yourself you can
download the notebooks `here <https://github.com/probabilistic-numerics/probnum/tree/master/docs/source/notebooks>`_.

Tutorials
===============
Learn how to use ProbNum. These notebooks show how to use random variables, the main in- and outputs of probabilistic
numerical methods and linear operators, how to apply probabilistic linear solvers and probabilistic approaches to
solving ordinary and partial differential equations.
