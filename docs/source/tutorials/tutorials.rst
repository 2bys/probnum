Tutorials
===============
See the notebooks below to learn more about how to use ProbNum and its functionality. We give an overview of the main subpackages of ProbNum and their probabilistic numerical methods. For example, we demonstrate how to apply probabilistic linear solvers and probabilistic approaches to solving ordinary and partial differential equations.

If you want to try out the examples for yourself you can
download the notebooks from the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/probabilistic-numerics/probnum/tree/master/docs/source/tutorials>`_.
